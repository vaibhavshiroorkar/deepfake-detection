# Changelog

This file records material changes to the software and research protocol.
Experiment metrics belong in the experiment tracker, not this file.

## Update rules

- Add current work under `Unreleased`.
- Record changes that affect behavior, data, models, evaluation, or users.
- Do not record routine experiment runs or daily progress.
- Move entries into a dated version when the project creates a release tag.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Versioned layered YAML configuration for reproducible local experiments.
- Runtime environment snapshots with Git, package, hardware, memory, and FFmpeg
  details, plus deterministic shared training seeds.
- A beginner handbook with a 15-chapter learning path and live foundations for
  the research problem, deep learning, audio-video timing, data leakage, and
  the implemented preprocessing pipeline.
- Handbook chapters for the current visual, audio, and synchronization model
  branches, plus calibrated late fusion, missing-evidence rejection, and
  planned candidate comparisons.
- A public CLI parser contract, generated CLI command reference, and CLI drift
  validation in `ddf-docs`.
- Repository-owned documentation validation for Markdown, local links, change
  contracts, and optional external links.
- A live roadmap with phase gates for the final-year project.
- Model selection rules for controlled component comparisons.
- A reproducibility contract for local experiments and future MLflow tracking.
- A threat model for research scope, failure modes, and misuse.
- A documentation index in the README.
- An approved specification for the project handbook and research evidence
  system.
